# Cycle ORM - Transactions
To persist entity changes, your application services and controllers will require `Cycle\ORM\TransactionInterface`.

## Default Configuration
By default, the framework will automatically create a transaction on-demand from the container. Considering that transactions always clean
after the `run` operation, you can request it as a constructor parameter.

```php
use Cycle\ORM;

class MyService
{
    private $tr;
    
    public function __construct(ORM\TransactionInterface $tr)
    {
        $this->tr = $tr;
    }
}
```

> Make sure that `persist`/`delete` and `run` methods are always called within one method scope while using service-specific transactions.

## Testing
You can always test the service by mocking `TransactionInterface`, consider binding mocked transaction object to your application instance to see what is being persisted.
